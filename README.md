# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

A modern, responsive version of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game, built as part of the [Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tic-tac-toe-game-Re7ZF_E2v).  

It might look simple, but for me it’s a huge milestone — just a few months ago I didn’t even know what *HTML* was. This is also my first bigger project in **TypeScript**! 🚀
